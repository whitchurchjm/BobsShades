For this sprint (1) we are introducing the first two use cases for our program that is designed to be a point of sale and customer record database for the small business Bobâ€™s simple window shades. Our first two use cases will be:

1)
Create and display a customer record that includes the new customer ID, address, phone number, and name. This will serve to keep track of previous sales and allow for possible future rewards and sales promotions to be sent to existing customers. 

2)
Save customer records to an external file to manage all customer records previously created but step 1). 

These two use cases work in tandem to achieve the first goal of our sales and records software, which is to create and save new customer and sales records. 



For our test cases (see start of document for screenshots), we implemented the following:

Select from a numerical menu which function is desired and see that the software correctly implements that function. In this case the options are to create a record and display a record. While testing, ensure that records are created and displayed properly.

Create a new employee record and save it to the database. This new employee record should be found in an external database or txt file. In this specific test case, we are using the file_records.txt file for storing customer and sales information.
